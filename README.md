Hello everyone, recently I have found source code of Bad Piggies game, 
so I decided to port it on vita.The problem is that there is only source 
of 2.3.6 version of this game made on newer version of Unity than i had to
use for vita. So I had to backport everything, and for now its running not so
good, but I will improve everything later.
Known problems:
- Engine sounds always playing
- Cant feed King Pig in courtroom
- Perfomance not optimal
For those who want to support me making unity game ports (and own pojects, of course): https://www.patreon.com/shockwawe
